# HamNoSys

HamNoSys is a system for the phonetic transcription of signed languages. The HamNoSysUnicode font uses the Unicode Private Use Area for the HamNoSys symbols. The font (and the symbol names) are taken from the TeX package _[hamnosys]("https://ctan.org/pkg/hamnosys?lang=en")_, maintained by Thomas Hanke & Marc Schulder.

To use, first install the font HamNoSysUnicode. (If you're using the [Typst web service]("https://typst.app"), you just need to include the font among your uploaded files.) See `readme.pdf` for details on how to use this in Typst.
